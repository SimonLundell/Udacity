Basic C++ Data Types

Now you know how to declare a variable in a statically typed language like C++. The C++ language has a handful of basic data types that you can use directly in your programs. These include integers, floats, and characters. Here is a table showing the most important basic data types that you will be using in the lesson:
data type 	declaration
integer 	int
floating point 	float
double floating point 	double
character 	char
boolean 	bool
valueless 	void

Some of these data types might look a bit unfamiliar. Here are some examples of each type:

integer

integers are whole numbers like -20 5 700 -19

floating point

floating points are real numbers containing decimals like 5.109 199.25 -1.278

double floating point

A double floating point can hold more decimals than a floating point; the tradeoff is that a double floating point requires more memory. The next part of the lesson goes into more detail about floating points versus double floating points.

character

The char type definition is for ASCII characters. ASCII represent the English language Roman alphabet and common mathematical symbols. A char variable can only hold one letter at a time; you cannot use a char type definition to represent a string.

examples of characters: a U l & @

boolean

Booleans are variables containing either true or false.

valueless

The void type definition is used for special cases. You cannot declare a void variable in C++. You'll find that void is used when a function does not return anything; a function might print something out to the terminal but not return a value.
