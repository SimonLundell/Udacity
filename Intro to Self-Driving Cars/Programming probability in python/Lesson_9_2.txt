Programming Probability Distributions
Introduction

It's time to get more experience programming in Python. Probability distributions involve algebraic functions and visualizing those functions.

You'll start out by making a few basic functions to calculate and visualize continuous uniform probability distributions.

Then, you'll program a more complex distribution: a non-uniform discrete probability distribution.

Next, you'll use those skills to explore how a self-driving car, or really any robot, might represent its location probabilities in a discrete, 1-D world. Then you'll expand into probabilities in a 2-D world. You're going to implement the 2-D world using something called a class, which is a sort of programming template. You'll learn more about classes in the exercises.

Finally, you'll become familiar with a probability distribution that is especially important to self-driving cars: the normal distribution.
