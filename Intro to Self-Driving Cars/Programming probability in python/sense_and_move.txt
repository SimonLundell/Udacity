Googles self-driving car is just a cycle of sense - move. An initial belief about the localization is tossed into the sense-move cycle, then the sense-move cycle is continuously happening, this is localization. Every time "move" happens, we lose information, and every time "sense" happen, we gain information. (probability is flattened during move, and hightened during sense).

Clarification Regarding Entropy

The video mentions that entropy will decrease after the motion update step and that entropy will increase after measurement step. What is meant is that that entropy will decrease after the measurement update (sense) step and that entropy will increase after the movement step (move).

In general, entropy represents the amount of uncertainty in a system. Since the measurement update step decreases uncertainty, entropy will decrease. The movement step increases uncertainty, so entropy will increase after this step.

Let's look at our current example where the robot could be at one of five different positions. The maximum uncertainty occurs when all positions have equal probabilities [0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2][0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2][0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2]

Following the formula Entropy=Σ(−p×log(p))Entropy = \Sigma (-p \times log(p))Entropy=Σ(−p×log(p)), we get −5×(.2)×log(0.2)=0.699-5 \times (.2)\times log(0.2) = 0.699−5×(.2)×log(0.2)=0.699.

Taking a measurement will decrease uncertainty and entropy. Let's say after taking a measurement, the probabilities become [0.05,0.05,0.05,0.8,0.05][0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.8, 0.05][0.05,0.05,0.05,0.8,0.05]. Now we have a more certain guess as to where the robot is located and our entropy has decreased to 0.338.
