Continuous Variables

In contrast, a variable like temperature is continuous. Temperature can take on any decimal value like -5.6 or 100.41 degrees.

Weight, height, temperature, longitude, and latitude are continuous variables. All of these variables could be decimal values. These variables have something else in common; you'd use some sort of instrument to measure them like a thermometer, a ruler, a scale or in the case of longitude, a chronometer.

Notice as well that you can't really associate counts with these variables. With a discrete variable like coins, you could count the number of times the coin landed on heads.

The probability distributions for discrete variables and continuous variables are different. In this lesson, you are going to learn the differences and similarities between the two.

However, height is normally a continuous variable, but if we decide to always round it to its nearest integer, it becomes a discrete variable.

In continuous probability, every outcome has probability 0 due to you will never be able to reach the accuracy defined in infinate space

for example spinning a pen around a circle, probability of pen landing on 180.0000000000...n is 0.

But if we define a clear interval we can set a probability:
0<x<180 -> P = 1/2
260<x<290 -> P = 1/12
179<x<180 -> P = 1/360
