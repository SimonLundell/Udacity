"""
We have the following info:

A = cancer
B = positive


P(A) = 0.2
P(B|A) = 0.9
P(<B|<A) = 0.5

Thus:
P(<A) = 0.8
P(<B|A) = 0.1
P(B|<A) = 0.5

We want P(A|B)!, so we must find P(B,A) and normalizer

Joints are:
P(B,A) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.2 * 0.9 = 0.18
P(B,<A) = P(<A) * P(B|<A) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4

Normalizer = 0.58

P(A|B) = P(B,A) / norm = 0.18/0.58
