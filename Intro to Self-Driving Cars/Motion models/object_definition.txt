Objects

Objects hold a state; they hold a group of variables/properties and functions.

You can imagine an Object like a box, and within that box are variables that define the state of an object and often functions that tell us what the object can do!

Ex:

Car is the object, it can contain:
variables - Position, velocity etc.
functions - move(self), turn_left(self) etc.
